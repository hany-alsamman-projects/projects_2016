Usage

{pyro:query:run query=“SELECT * FROM table”}
{field_name}
{/pyro:query:run}

Simple provide your query as the query parameter, and the plugin will make all the fields returned by your query available as variables.

In addition, PyroQuery returns two special variables:
{query.odd_even}

Returns “odd” or “even” based on the row being displayed.
{query.last_row}

Returns “yes” or “no” based on whether the row being displayed is the last one.
Debugging

If PyroQuery encounters a MySQL error, it will, by default, just return nothing. However, if you pass a debug parameter set to “on”, PyroQuery will display the database error.

{pyro:query:run query=“SECT * FROM table” debug="on"}
{field_name}
{/pyro:query:run}

This would return:

You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near ‘SECT * FROM table’ at line 1
